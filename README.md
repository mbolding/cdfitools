software tools for fMRI at the Center for Development of Functional Imaging

About this site:

Howto documents and snippets of code that might be useful for functional MRI and psychophysics. mainly Matlab, C, and LabVIEW. We have a vertical 4.7T Varian scanner.

Contact mbolding@uab.edu if you have any questions.

About the CDFI:

The University of Alabama at Birmingham Center for the Development of Functional Imaging was established by the University of Alabama Board of Trustees in 2002 to advance the visual and neural sciences. The goal of the Center is develop and exploit new technologies to better understand brain function. A primary means of accomplishing this goal is the combined use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with more invasive physiological techniques to better understand the role of the brain in controlling behavior. This approach will allow us to appreciate both the overall patterns of brain activity and the role of specific neuronal circuits as the same time.
